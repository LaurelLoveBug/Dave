				<h2>Once Upon a Time</h2>
				<p>A long time ago, there was a man who sat on the beach looking for peace and happiness. He was kind to the people and many people liked him, but he still sat alone at the beach thinking about things.<br/><br/>
				Day after day, he sat there and watched the people come and go until one day he saw a young clusmy girl come to the beach. She was shy, but he said, "Hi." But since the girl was shy, it was a rough start to their story.<br/><br/>
				After many tries, the girl went out with the man and they became good friends after that night. They spent their nights doing naughty and funny things - like nerf shooting Fresco, or chasing each other with sniffing-llamas, playing with $5 footlongs, and staying up way too late. And through it all they fell in love.<br/><br/>
				And through that love, they grew stronger and closer and happier togtether. Finally the peace that both of them wanted was found in each other.<br/><br/>
				With so many memories, so many moments shared with each other, nothing can tear them apart and nothing can stop them. And together, they will face the life ahead of them with warmth, happiness, and smiles in their hearts.<br/><br/>
				The story is far from over, and the rest of the pages will be written over the course of many many years. But the important thing is this. That the young man and the young woman finally found true everlasting love.</p>

				<h1>Memories of Our Love</h1>
				<p>We are that man and that woman. We met on that beach so long ago, and we've made so many memories together.<br/><br/>
				It's been an amazing time with you. All of our dates, our love making, our adventures, our stories, our snuggles, and our jokes make me smile, and I cannot wait to make more with you.<br/><br/>
				I love you so much, Sweet Pea.</p>
